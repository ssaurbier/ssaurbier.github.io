                            <p>Webscraping (PRAW) used to pull data from Reddit Subreddits and create an NLP model to predict the origin of a Subreddit based on title text. Sleep Training and Attachment Parenting are the two mainstream methods of infant sleeping that new parents use to get their children to sleep. Those that subscribe to the attachment parenting philosophy generally sleep with their children and, therefore, have less need for the range of monitoring equipment from audio/video monitoring to vital sign monitoring. Whereas those in the Sleep Training camp begin sleeping apart from their children in their early weeks of their infants life and tend to purchase more monitoring equipment. Here an hyperparameter optimized stacking classification model consisting of TfidVectorized text from post titles in the Sleep Training and Attachment Parenting Subrredits modeled with Random Forest Classifier, MultinomialNB and AdaBoost with Decision  and Logistic Regression is created and evaluated for class prediction. The stacked model will categorize individuals as "sleep trainers" or "attachment parents" based on their post title patterns. The stacked model can be applied to other social media platforms to predict if individuals are a good target for baby monitor advertising. </p>

                            <p>Acute lymphoblastic leukemia, ALL, is the most common type of childhood cancer and accounts for almost 25% of all pediatric cancers in the United States. Here a binary classification model is created to identify morphological characteristics of white blood cells to determine if they have normal morphology or morphology that is consistent with a leukemia blast (a cancerous white blood cell associated with ALL ). This model will help to reduce costs and time in diagnosing possible cases of ALL. Conventional diagnostics include a blood test that counts the number of white and red blood cells in a sample. Elevated white blood cell counts can suggest the possibility of ALL. Currently, if a sample indicates elevated white blood cell counts it is then subjected to flow cytometry and then the possibility of patient biopsy of bone marrow or lymph node tissue. Introducing a technique such as Quantitative Cell Imaging paired with computational modeling in tandem with routine health exams or blood tests that exhibit elevated white blood cell counts can reduce costs and time for diagnosis improving the chances of successful treatment.</p>

                            <div class="subheading mb-3">A Convoluted Neural Network (CNN) Model for Image Recognition Deployed in Streamlit</div>
                            <p>Image recognition refers to the ability of a model to accurately identify a target within an image. Image recognition is utilized in a number of different industries from identifying possible faults in a manufacturing line to determining if an individual possesses anatomical abnormalities in healthcare. Image recognition is also used in artificial Intelligence (AI) programs to identify individuals based on facial features or create new faces modeled after previously identified features. The applications of image recognition are vast and the cornerstone for many emerging technologies.  Here a Convoluted Neural Network is created to determine if an image contains or does not contain a hot dog. The CNN model is compared to a transfer learning model,  EfficientNetB0, which has been trained on more images than was contained in the Kaggle data set to create the CNN model.  Ultimately, the transfer model was used in the Streamlit deployment of the image recognition app.

As a first generation high school and college grad, I understand the obstacles faced by underrepresented and underserved individuals when it comes to higher education. I have visited schools in small communities accross Montana and Missouri and mentored young adults to help them know what opportunities are avilable to them, help them build confidence and overcome imposter syndrome.
